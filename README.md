# Store Manager API

## Introduction:

Store Manager is a RESTFul API developed in the Back-end Module at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)  Web Development course. <br />
It is a sales management system that presents all the CRUD methods.<br />

During this project I was able to implement unit tests for all layers of the MSC model of software architecture. 
This practice ensures greater reliability and security in requests and responses returned to clients.

  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>:game_die: <strong>Configuring the database connection</strong></summary>

  1. Creating the configuration file
  
  - Create an .env file in the project root:
    - `touch .env`;
    
  - Place the following information in the .env file and replace with your credentials:    
    ```
    MYSQL_HOST=localhost
    MYSQL_USER=yourUser
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourPassword
    MYSQL_DATABASE=StoreManager
    PORT=3000
    ```
   >NOTE: You will need to create a local database to use this API. In this manual, I called the database name as StoreManager, but you can call it whatever you want. It's just important that you make sure to create one database and configure it at the .env file to the API work properly.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>:running: <strong>Running the API locally</strong></summary>
  
  - Run the following command in the terminal from the project root::
  
    - `npm start`;
    
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>:whale: <strong>Running via Docker</strong></summary><br>
  <p>If you wanted and have the knowledge of how to use it, there is a file <em><strong>docker-compose</strong></em> in the root of the project, follow the commands create and access the containers:</p>
  
  - At the root of the project run the following command:
  
    - `docker-compose up -d`;
    
  - To access the container terminal, run the following command:
  
    - `docker container exec -it store_manager bash`;
  
  - To close the container terminal, run the command:
  
    - `exit`;
    
  - If you are no longer using containers, run the following command:
  
    - `docker-compose down`;
  </details>

  <summary>ðŸ§ª <strong>Unit Tests</strong></summary><br>
  <p>To see the test coverage of the MSC architecture model:</p>
  
  - Run the following command:
  
    - `npm run test:mocha`;
   
   >NOTE: If you are running the API via docker, run the above command inside the container.
